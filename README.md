HHblits and hmmer - python script

The two scripts uploaded here will extract protein sequences based on their cluster grouping and perform multiple sequences alignment using Hmmer package or hhblits package. The aligned sequence will then be used to generate a profile using both hmmer and hhblits package. 
Make sure you have hhmmer and hhblits package installed and are in the path before running these scripts.
